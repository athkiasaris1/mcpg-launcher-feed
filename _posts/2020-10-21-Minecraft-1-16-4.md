It's time for the 1.16.4 release! This release adds the new social interactions screen and fixes a few crashes.
If you missed it, we recently announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. This release prepares for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492), which will be continuously updated.

- New UI called Social Interactions Screen
- A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

Keep surviving!
